**How to play!**

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking spaces on the grid with their respective symbols ('X' or 'O'). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all spaces are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

  

**How to run!**

To run the game, navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:

  
```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the game on a local server. You can then access the game by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

  

**How to play!**

To make a move, click on an empty square on the board. The game will automatically switch between 'X' and 'O' turns. The game will end when a player wins or the game is a draw. To start a new game, click the 'New Game' button. If you need help making a move, click the 'Help' button to have the computer make a random move for you.

  

**Source code!**

The source code for this game can be found in the App.jsx file. It uses React components and state to manage the game board and handle user input. The game logic is implemented in the checkWinner function, which checks for winning combinations of symbols on the board.
